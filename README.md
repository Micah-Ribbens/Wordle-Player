# Summary
This project plays Wordle optimally. It does this by figuring out the probabilities 
that any given letter is in the secret word. It also updates the probabilities based 
upon the information it gets from 'Wordle.' Once the project is done, I will see the 
average number of guesses it takes to guess the secret word. The code uses a trie for 
the word finding and number probabilites.
